A simple web-­‐application To Do list, with the following features: 

• Shows the current date, with a list of all the To Do items
• Allows the user to tick off an item in the list (as Done)
• Allows the user to tick off an item in the list (as Cancelled)
• At the end of the current date, all items not ticked off as Done or Cancelled will be transferred to the next day
